 USING GALANEXT:
 
 If you are using a GNU/Linux system, you can directly run the "Galanext" file in the root folder. Make sure that the "resources" folder is next to the "Galanext" file.
 If this one doesn't work or if you're useing another operating system, you have to compile the program.
 To compile the game, you need a C++ compiler and the SFML 2.1 API for this compiler. Then you just have to compile all the files which are in the "src" folder.
 
 LICENSE:
 
 All the project is under the GNU GPLv3 license, the source files are included with the game.
 
 CHANGELOG:
 
 GALANEXT VERSION 0.1:
 * Initial version with only a moving space background and a spaceship you can move with the keyboard. The spaceship is also able to fire.
