Using Galanext
--------------

If you are using a GNU/Linux system, you can directly run the *Galanext* file in the root folder. Make sure that the *resources* folder is next to the *Galanext* file. If it does not work, you can try running the *start_galanext.sh* script.

If it still does not work or if you are using another operating system, you have to compile the program.

To compile the game, you need a C++ compiler and the SFML 2.3 API for this compiler. You can also use CMake (http://www.cmake.org/).
