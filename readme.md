Using Galanext
--------------

If you are using a GNU/Linux system, you can directly run the "Galanext" file in the root folder. Make sure that the "resources" folder is next to the "Galanext" file.

If this one doesn't work or if you're using another operating system, you have to compile the program.

To compile the game, you need a C++ compiler and the SFML 2.2 API for this compiler. You can also use CMake (http://www.cmake.org/).

License

All the project is under the GNU GPLv3 license, the source files are included with the game.
