Using Galanext
--------------

If you are using a GNU/Linux system, you can run the *linux/Galanext* file. The *linux/Galanext-dev* file is compiled from the current development version.

Windows users can run the *windows/Galanext.exe* file. This version seems to have some display problems, it probably comes from my computer so you can try to compile it yourself.

If it does not work or if you are using another operating system, you have to compile the program.

To compile the game, you need a C++ compiler and the SFML 2.3 API for this compiler. You can also use CMake (http://www.cmake.org/).

License
